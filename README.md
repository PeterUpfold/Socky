Listen on TCP sockets to observe connection attempts to servers on the local network.

This is designed to provide some level of visibility into any activities on your system where local servers
running on Well-Known (and merely well-known, if you catch my drift) ports are being enumerated.

**Note:** that this is not particularly serious or practical, but I wanted a project that let me work directly
with the Core Foundation APIs in C, and this seemed a good opportunity.
